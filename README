Welcome to asm16, my child from the public domain.

Original asm6 readme in README-OLD.

It's basically asm6 for the snes, or any other machine
you find that uses a WDC 65816 processor.

You should be able to write a program for asm16 just like
you would for asm6, but with the extra opcodes and 24-bit
addressing and such. If not, bug reports are welcome.

Test ROM is in the test folder (warning sloppy source), build with:
asm16 test/main.s test/test.sfc

Currently unsupported instructions: pei, mvn, mvp. Can
be replaced through the following macros (thanks hamtaro126):

.macro PEI indirect
.db $D4, indirect
.endm

.macro MVP srcbank, dstbank
.db $44, srcbank, dstbank
.endm

.macro MVN srcbank dstbank
.db $54, srcbank, dstbank
.endm
