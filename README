This is my little child from out of the public domain.

I'm gonna turn asm6 into a 65816 assembler.

So first, let's collect the new opcodes.

stz
brl
bra
sep
rep
xce
pea
pei
per
phb
phd
phk
phx
phy
plb
pld
plp
plx
ply
trb
tsb
tcd
tcs
tdc
tsc
txy
tyx
mvn
mvp
jml
jsl
rtl
cop
stp
wai
xba

That was a stupid long list, so let's divide things up.

These opcodes have no arguments (easiest to implement).

xce
phb
phd
phk
phx
phy
plb
pld
plx
ply
tcd
tcs
tdc
tsc
txy
tyx
rtl
stp
wai
xba

Let's go ahead and add those to the program...

Easy enough, very tedious implementations.

Now let's see what's left.

stz
brl
bra
sep
rep
pea
pei
per
trb
tsb
tcd
tcs
mvn
mvp
jml
jsl
cop

Nothing too bad, but new addressing modes
are present now. asm16 needs to know about
them! So let's list them out.

Stolen from https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/images/7/76/Programmanual.pdf

Program Counter Relative Long; BRL; JMPLABEL
Stack Relative; LDA; 3, S
Stack Relative Indirect Indexed with Y; LDA; (5,S), Y
Block Move; MVP; 0,0
Absolute Long; LDA; $02F000
Absolute Long Indexed with X; LDA; $12D080, X
Absolute Indirect Long; JMP; [$2000]
Direct Page Indirect Long; LDA; [$55]
Direct Page Indirect Long Indexed with Y; LDA; [$55], Y

Currently we're just concerned with adding new stuff to enums.

Those are all in with respective names:
RELL, RELS, RELSY, BMV, ABSL, ABSLX, ABSIL, ZPIL, ZPILY.
I'm just referring to direct page as ZP for now. Not sure
if custom DP control is a planned feature.

So let's try adding some of those opcodes in...it takes a while.
